### 4. Filtering and Slicing
- Incorporated slicers and filters for dynamic data exploration.
- Users can drill down and slice data by various attributes such as coverage type, policy type, customer type, sales channels, and vehicles.

### 5. Key Metrics
- Highlighted the following important metrics:
- Total Claims: Analyzed the overall claims processed.
- Average Claim Amount: Measured the average cost per claim.

- Included pages focused on specific categories, such as:
   - Insurance by Coverage
   - Insurance by Customer Type
   - Insurance by Policy Type
   - Insurance by Sales Channel
   - Insurance by Vehicle
   - KPI Page with summary-level insights.
